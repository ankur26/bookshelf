# BookShelf - The Odin Project's Project Series.

BookShelf Project from TOP's Project series, this project is introduced to get us more familiar with Javascript Objects and finally use something similar to a database to mimic a bookshelf.

The project itself is a bookshelf/library, which stores a list of books with some basic information and allows us to modify it and add new ones using forms and buttons. 

### Topics covered.
1. Javascript Objects.
2. Data creation/manipulation using forms and their handling.


### Implementation

Project is a very barebones functionality as the objective here was to solidify our JS concepts on Objects. Bootstrap was used for the CSS.
